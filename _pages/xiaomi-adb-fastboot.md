1. Enable developer options in Android.

    * MIUI: Go to Settings > About device and tap ‘MIUI version’ seven times to enable developer options.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* **Q:** The tool doesn't launch on my computer, is there anything I should have installed?

    * **A:** Yes, the tool was developed for Java and needs the Java Runtime Environment to run. You can install Java from [here](https://java.com/en/download/). On Linux, OpenJFX is needed alongside OpenJRE to run the application.

* **Q:** The tool on Windows doesn't detect my device even though it's connected and USB debugging is enabled. What could be the issue?

    * **A:** Windows most likely does not recognise your device in ADB. Install the universal ADB drivers from [here](http://dl.adbdriver.com/upload/adbdriver.zip).

* **Q:** Do I need an unlocked bootloader or root access to use the tool?

    * **A:** The Image Flasher, Wiper and Camera2 modules require an unlocked bootloader but everything else works without rooting or unlocking.

* **Q:** Do uninstalled system apps affect OTA updates?

    * **A:** No, you are free to install updates without the fear of bricking your device or losing data.

* **Q:** Why does the Uninstaller hang on some apps?

    * **A:** There are many factory apps Global MIUI doesn't let you uninstall but China MIUI does. If you try to uninstall such an app, the tool will hang. Disconnect your device, uninstall the app then connect and load your device again to proceed.

* **Q:** How do I regain uninstalled system apps?

    * **A:** When you uninstall apps, you erase them from `/data` so you need to factory reset (wipe data) to make your device reinstall them (from `/system`).

* **Q:** The tool is called Xiaomi ADB/Fastboot Tools. Does that mean it only works with Xiaomi devices?

    * **A:** ADB and Fastboot are universal interfaces for Android devices but some of the algorithms and methods used in the app are specific to Xiaomi devices, so yes.

* **Q:** Does this replace MiFlash or MiUnlock?

    * **A:** No. Fastboot ROM flashing is available, but implementing other features in such a simple tool would only make it unnecessarily complex.
