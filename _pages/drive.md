{% include adsense1.html %}
Incase you haven’t heard, Google Drive has a few fans: 800 million active users as of March, 2017. That 300 million more than Dropbox. Most of that popularity is deserved, too.

Google Drive is an outlier: it’s a cloud storage tool aimed at home users that packs an arsenal of features that help you get work done.

Google Docs, an expansive third-party app library, collaboration features and great support are among the positive checkmarks we’ll discuss in this Google Drive review. You also get 15GB of free storage, which for many users will be plenty of space. Read more at [detailed review of google drive](https://storage.knoacc.org/drive)
