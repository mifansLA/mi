With close to a billion users, Google Drive is the most popular cloud storage service in the world. If you’re a Google user or you have an Android phone, you already use the service, which certainly helps pad the numbers.

Google’s apps are renowned for their ease of use and Google Drive is no exception. It’s one of the best services for collaboration thanks to Google’s office suite and huge library of third-party apps. If that’s your business’s focus, consult our best enterprise file sync and share guide for services that fit the bill. Google Drive has good sharing capabilities and fast transfer speeds, too.

Google’s security and privacy aren’t as strong as you’d get from some of its competitors. You can find them on our list of the best cloud storage services. Google Drive’s pricing plans aren’t particularly competitive, either.

But it is good service in general.
