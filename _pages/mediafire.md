### How good is Mediafire?

It’s hard what to make of cloud storage provider MediaFire: on the one hand it lacks desktop syncing and versioning capabilities and it doesn’t publicize what, if any, security measures are in place to protect users’ files.

On the other hand, while it certainly falls far short of our best cloud storage picks, MediaFire may still appeal to some users thanks to strong mobile support for images, a generous allotment of free storage and low pricing.

To try MediaFire yourself, visit MediaFire for 10GB of free storage, with the opportunity to earn up to 50GB extra by referring friends and completing other tasks. Otherwise, read on as we review MediaFire’s highs and lows
