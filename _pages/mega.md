### How good is MEGA?
MEGA is one of the most controversial cloud storage services out there: it was founded by the infamous Kim Dotcom in 2013, a year after his previous cloud storage service, MegaUpload, was shut down by the FBI.

Kim Dotcom is no longer associated with MEGA, which now markets itself as “the privacy company” on account of its use of zero-knowledge encryption and its headquarters in privacy-friendly New Zealand.

The top reason to signup for MEGA in the past, however, was its offer of 50GB of free storage. Unfortunately, its free offer was reduced to 15GB is 2017 with little acknowledgment from the company. While you can still earn big boosts to your storage allotment through a rewards program, the rewards earned expire, limiting their value and jeopardizing MEGA’s place as one of the best free cloud storage services.
