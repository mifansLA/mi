## POCO App version

The app in this version using: `POCO Launcher 2.6.1.3`, we use APK downloaded with Android 5.1 phone from [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mi.android.globallauncher).

## Update The App Version.

You can find the new update version [here](https://mi.knoacc.org/poco-magisk-module). Leave a comment if you found an updated version before we update to the latest. It's not a mandatory, except you still want POCO as a system app.

But if ain't, do directly update from Playstore if there is new version available.

### NOTE: Bear With It!

- It is a trial workaround from [MiFans Lamongan](https://mi.knoacc.org/) admins.
- This isn't maintained project and not published in Magisk repo. You Won't get nofication update from Magisk Manager.
