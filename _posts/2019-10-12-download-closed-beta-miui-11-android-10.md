The MIUI 11 **closed beta** nightlies from October 9th reveal that the aforementioned devices are now getting a bump up to Android 10.

With the update, **Xiaomi Mi 8**, **Mi Mix 2S** and the **Mi Mix 3** will receive **Android 10** exclusive features like a system-wide dark theme, new gesture navigation, and more.

However, these builds are part of a closed beta update, so it’ll be a while before they hit the [beta stable channel](/download-miui-11-beta-semua-tipe). If you own any one of these three devices and want to try out the Android 10 update for yourself, you can download the respective update packages by following the links below.

But before you go ahead and flash it on your device take note that these are very early versions of the software and you might experience some unforeseen issues.
