The Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi is best known for its affordable smartphones and custom MIUI user interface. It arrives with enhanced features compared to Stock Android for all the Xiaomi devices. Although being a custom skin, the company is a bit slower to provide the latest Android updates, the same applies to MIUI 11. Even if you get the new update, the custom MIUI skin hides all the stock android features behind the bar with highly customized user-interface.

Currently, most of the **Xiaomi devices are running on MIUI 10** by eagerly waiting for its successor MIUI 11. However, the company has already started the **Android 10 Q beta program** for the Xiaomi Mi 9 based on MIUI 10, but stable MIUI 11 is still in progress. Previously, MIUI product manager indicated **MIUI 11 to get official in the September** month.

## MIUI 11 Development

Recently, Xiaomi completed the MIUI 10 beta face, which means the company will now focus on MIUI 11. The company confirms **MIUI 9.8.29 version is the last beta version** of MIUI 10 under its beta testing program. Of course, the latest MIUI11 stable ROM will take some time in development. Moreover, the company starts poring Beta update to Redmi K20 Pro and Mi 9 at the same time the Android 10 arrives at Pixel smartphones. However, Android 10 beta is running on older MIUI, meaning the company is seriously working to provide the latest updates to its consumers.

## MIUI 11 Top Features

The new MIUI user interface will be based on the latest features of the Android 10 OS, therefore, we can expect a lot of advancements over the traditional MIUI 10. It will borrow most of the Android Q features to use it on the independent environment of MIUI 11. In the meantime, the company **accidentally pushed the MIUI 11 update to some Xiaomi devices** [see image](https://i0.wp.com/piunikaweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mi_mix_2s_miui_11_9.9.3_ota.jpg) displaying us the new icons and settings menu. Starting with the Settings menu, the icons are different colors and sizes, which could play handy roles to identify each icon instantly.

### MIUI 11 Settings Menu

Another big change is in system apps and menus. There is a big white space in between and big bold text too easy to spot. It further adds improved Always-on-display features and new cross-file-sharing platform that the company developed working with Oppo and Vivo. The new Always-on Display gives plenty of new options like changing the text color automatically over time, or enable Kaleidoscope with five different patterns. It is even capable of changing the light depending on the daytime at your location.

### MIUI 11 Dark Mode, AOD and Quick Replies

Although the development is using MIUI 10, we expect a similar kind of look & feel with new MIUI 11. The upcoming update is said to arrive with a **significant upgrade** over its predecessor with enhanced user interface and stability. Some Chinese reports claim that the MIUI 11 will make its debut along with MI Mix 4, but we can’t confirm these rumors unless we get any official announcement from the company.

The Xiaomi smartphones list has confirmed by unofficial sources, that will get the new MIUI update in the near future.

These devices are almost more than two years old, so it is even harder to provide all the new features. The company still cares about its older audience. **The devices aren’t confirmed**.
