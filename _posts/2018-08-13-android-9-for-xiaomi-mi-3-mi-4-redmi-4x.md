Xiaomi Mi 3, Xiaomi Mi 4, & Xiaomi Redmi 4X get Android Pie (Android 9) ports.
{:.notice.notice--info}

Google released Android 9 Pie for the Google Pixel/XL and the Google Pixel 2/XL last week. The latest version of Android comes with significant improvements including a new gesture navigation system, a new Material Design theme, Digital Well-being, privacy and security improvements, and more. In terms of updates, the Essential Phone is the only third-party Android phone to have received 

the Android Pie update so far (in fact, it received it on day one). Other smartphones eligible for the Android Pie beta program should be receiving updates in the next few weeks, but for those smartphones that are not due to receive official updates especially quickly, there is always the development community to help.

The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S was part of the Android Pie beta program, and Xiaomi is testing an alpha build of Android Pie for it. Other Xiaomi smartphones probably won’t receive Android Pie updates for months, but users interested in trying out AOSP can use Android Pie today.

This week we saw the Qualcomm variant of the [Xiaomi Redmi Note 4](https://mi.knoacc.org/redmi-note-4-android-9-pie-stable) recieve a stable Android Pie port with **everything working**. Xiaomi phones have a thriving development community on XDA, so it’s no surprise to see that the **Xiaomi Mi 3/Xiaomi Mi 4** and the **Xiaomi Redmi 4X** have also received stable Android Pie ports.

### Current status of development

The Xiaomi Mi 3 and the Xiaomi Mi 4 share a common device code-name: _cancro_. It means that the same **ROM will work on both devices**. The developers _vasishath_ and _Shahan_mik3_ note no major bugs with the ROM, which is great to see considering the fact that 
- Android Pie is only a week old, and
- The Xiaomi Mi 3 and the Mi 4 are 2013-2014 devices.

The **Xiaomi Redmi 4X** (device code-name: santoni) on the other hand, was released in 2017 as the successor to the Redmi 3S. In India, it’s sold as the Redmi 4, which is yet another example of Xiaomi’s confusing branding. The Android 9 port is itself ported from the Redmi Note 4’s Android Pie port. The developer notes that the port for the **Redmi 4X has a bug** of not allowing users to change headphone volume. Other features should be working fine, though.
