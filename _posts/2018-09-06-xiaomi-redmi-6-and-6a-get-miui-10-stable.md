**Xiaomi Redmi 6 and the Xiaomi Redmi 6A** both were released in China earlier this year (and India next week), though with MIUI 9. While MIUI 10’s global version was announced shortly after that, MIUI 10 China was announced a few weeks before with an update schedule following for both regions a month prior. Now, finally, the Xiaomi Redmi 6 and the Xiaomi Redmi 6A have received an **MIUI 10 China Stable** build which you can flash as a recovery ROM.

Those with Global variants will have to wait, though. The Global version of MIUI includes Google Play Services and a number of different languages, while the Chinese versions [do not include Google Play Services](https://www.knoacc.org/2018/07/download-google-installer-v2-apk-android-china.html). They also have limited language support, though there is usually an included English option that can be enabled. Still, the lack of Google services is usually enough to turn people off from switching to the Chinese builds of MIUI, even if they do get earlier updates.

Both builds for the **Xiaomi Redmi 6** and the **Xiaomi Redmi 6A** are based on [Android 8.1](/2018/05/fitur-android-oreo-terbaru.html) Oreo. MIUI 10 has a lot of [new features](https://www.knoacc.org/2018/09/fitur-fitur-keren-miui-10-terbaru.html), with a heavy emphasis on AI. You get a newly redesigned user interface for starters, AI camera features, and an AI-based pre-loader that pre-loads applications based on your usual daily phone usage routines. It’s all pretty cool, and fans of MIUI will probably find themselves pretty happy with the update.

If you’re wondering how to install it, those on the Chinese Stable ROM should receive the update via OTA soon if it’s on Xiaomi’s servers. We don’t actually know if it’s rolling out normally. If you’d rather not wait, though, you can download the recovery ROM download links below. They can be [flashed in TWRP by following these instructions](https://www.knoacc.org/2018/09/cara-flash-miui-10-stabil-redmi-6-6a-twrp.html). Both files are roughly 1.7GB in size.
