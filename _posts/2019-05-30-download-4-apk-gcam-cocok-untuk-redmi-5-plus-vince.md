This article compiles Google Camera (gcam) app known compatible for Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus (codename Vince). You can download its APK files through our mirror direct links provided below.

MIUI is a professionally-designed Android ROM for Xiaomi phones. It includes all essential apps for day-to-day usage, including the Camera app. It would be useless if an Android phone has a great camera without a camera app.

However, some users were not quite happy with the stock camera. The absence of manual control and certain photography algorithm are just few of the causes.

The great camera quality is undeniably excellent on most of Xiaomi flagship phones. The photos shot on Mi Mix 2s, Mi 8, or Mi Mix 3 are stunning. That quality is worth its price. Such a flagship phone features Camera2 API enabled by default.

Some users simply prefer to have a decent phone with a just-enough specification. Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus is not truly a budget phone. Instead, it is a mid-range phone that inherits perfect specifications at its price point. It is a steal-deal Android phone.

Powered with Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC, its machine is capable to process 4K HD videos and 480p 60fps videos. Thanks to its Omnivision camera planted on the rear side.

Nevertheless, the stock MIUI Camera app is not as good as third-party app.

Enter Google Camera! Many Android users around the globe are stunned by the awesomeness of Google Camera app. The app which was originally crafted for Google phones such as Nexus, Pixel, Pixel 2, or Pixel 3.

This is not without a reason. Google phones sport only a single camera but it can produce beautiful bokeh along with stunning HDR processing. High Dynamic Range feature within the Gcam has several level. Its highest one, the HDR+ Enhanced utilizes Google’s secret Artificial Intelligent (AI) algorithm. It can produces stunning photos in no time.

Thankfully, there have been many ported builds (modded) of Gcam. Many non-Google devices are now compatible to run the most wanted photography app.

There is one drawback whatsoever. Not every device is compatible with certain version of ported gcam. If one build of gcam works on device A, it doesn’t necessarily work on device B. For instance, if Gcam v8.1b by Arnova8G2 works on Mi 8, it may or may not work on Redmi 5 Plus.

Hence, it is crucial to find out what works on other users of the same phone.

Here are Gcam app proven compatible to run on Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus. Google Cam makes use of Android Camera2 API. You can enable this required API only if your bootloader is unlocked.

### Download Gcam APK

**Gcam ported by Arnova8G2:** These two gcam APK files are ported from Google Pixel 2. Some of the key features including: Slow Motion up to 120 fps, Panorama, Photo Sphere, Lens Blur, Portrait, and HDR+ Enhanced. It also features Motion photo (not with HDR+). When Motion Photo is on, each photo you capture could include a short video before and after the shot. The video may be embedded when you share the photo.

The two builds below work flawlessly on Redmi 5 Plus running latest MIUI 10 (based on Android 8.1 Oreo). They also work on MIUI 9 based on Android 7.1 Nougat but you may expect random force close situation.

| File name : | GoogleCamera-Pixel2Mod-Arnova8G2-V8.1.apk |
| Version 8.1 | Size: 37 MB |
| Download | [here](https://miui.blog/file/947/) |

| File name : |GCam-5.1.018-Pixel2Mod-Arnova8G2-V8.3b1.apk |
| Version 5.1.018 build 8.3b1 | Size: 37 MB |
| Download | [here](https://miui.blog/file/949/) |

**Gcam ported by BSG:** Google cam APK file below is ported from Pixel 3 device. This one is built with better compatibility on Android 8.1. We really recommend you to use this modded build if you want to taste its _Night Shade_ feature on MIUI 10.

| File name : | MGC_6.1.021_FINAL_V1b_A8.1-bsg.apk
| Version 6.1.021 final v1b | Size: 79 MB |
| Download | [here](https://miui.blog/file/951/)|

**Gcam ported by CStark27:** Ported from Pixel 3 as well, the gcam APK file below is modded by Cstark. It has better compatibility for Android 9.x Pie. We recommend this build if you run custom Android 9 ROM on your Redmi 5 Plus. This version has features of all previous gcam versions with the Night Sight feature being added.

| File name : | P3v9.1_GoogleCamera_6.1.021-cstark27.apk |
| Version 6.1.021 | Size: 89 MB |

Google Night Sight is a breakthrough feature added on the latest version of gcam. It helps you capture vibrant and detailed low-light photos without a flash or tripod. However, the Night Sight can capture more light when Pixel and the scene are still.

> **How does the feature work?**
>
> Night Sight measures your natural hand shake, as well as how much motion is in the scene. If Pixel is stable and the scene is still, Night Sight will spend more time capturing light to minimize noise; if Pixel is moving or there’s significant scene motion, Night Sight will use shorter exposures, capturing less light to minimize motion blur.@

Which one should I use on Redmi 5 Plus? That depends. If you prefer stability over features, use one of APKs modded by Arnova8G2. If you prefer features over stability and your phone is running MIUI 10, use the one ported by BSG. Use the one released by Cstark if your phone runs Android 9.x Pie; this could be through a custom ROM or if Xiaomi has updated the MIUI to Android 9.x Pie.
