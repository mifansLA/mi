It’s no secret that Xiaomi devices are some of the most popular on our forums. For pretty much every (Qualcomm Snapdragon) Xiaomi device released, there’s always an abundance of custom ROMs that come out for it. The **Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro** is no different and has now received an official build of **LineageOS 15.1**. Now’s a good time to flash the ROM as doing it before you update your MIUI will allow you to downgrade your device afterward. If you want to download and install it, you can check out the link below.

LineageOS 15.1 has a huge amount of features present and it’s **a whole lot _less bloated_ than MIUI**. Fans of Xiaomi devices often visit other forums because they want to use alternative software to MIUI, so if you’re interested in trying something new you can check out the download page linked below for where the official builds are released. Also be sure to download the official TWRP and visit the respected forums to stay up to date on the latest developments for the device.
